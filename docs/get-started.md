# Quick Start

RagAmp is a retrieval-augmented generation application for antimicrobial peptides.

## Overview

The tool is designed to encode unstructured text data (e.g., academic papers) about
antimicrobial peptides and build vectorstores with their embeddings. It then uses
this vectorstore to retrieve relevant documents to answer user queries. The queries
can be arbitrary, but in our particular use case, they are engineered to investigate
whether the model can propose novel hypotheses for AMP-microbe interactions such
as suggesting novel potential targets that an AMP can be operating on based on its
existing known targets.
